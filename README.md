# Searching Algorithms:
## Linear Search

Input: array, element;

Result: The indexes of the element if found or "Null" if not found;

Process: Look at every element to find the needed one;

## Binary Search

Input: Sorted array, element;

Result: The index of the element if found or "Null" if not found;

Process: Repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until it's narrowed down to just one;

# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort
Input: Unsorted array;

Result: Sorted array;

Process: Compares the elements and swaps them till the largest(smallest) element is at the end of the unsorted part of the list;


## Selection Sort

Input: Unsorted array;

Result: Sorted array;

Process: Repeatedly  selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted list and swaps it with the leftmost element of the unsorted portion;

## Insertion Sort

Input: Unsorted array;

Result: Sorted array;

Process: splits the array into two parts: the sorted and the unsorted part.Then you pick an element from the unsorted part and put it in the right place in the sorted part.
